#  NBA Data Analysis - README

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a solution architecture and implementing a data analytics system to analyze NBA basketball matches from the 2000-2001 season. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis, providing insights for basketball analysts and team management groups.

##  Tasks and Deliverables

###  Task 1 - Designing a Solution Architecture

Design a system architecture to analyze real-time and historical data.

###  Task 2 - Data Analysis

Perform data analysis using various tools and frameworks:

1.  **Hadoop MapReduce**
2.  **Hive or Pig**
3.  **Spark**

###  Task 3 - Machine Learning with Spark MLlib

Build a predictive model to estimate the average points a player must score to ensure a win for their team.

###  Task 4 - Presentation of the Analysis

Create a static web page or dashboard to display the results of the analysis:

1.  **Visualization Topics**:

- Most scoring quarter for each team.
- Top 5 teams based on total points.
- Percentage of players scoring 40+ points in a single match.
- Total matches won and lost by each team.

2.  **Design Considerations**:

- Ensure clear presentation of data.
- Focus on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) aspects for better accessibility and understanding.
